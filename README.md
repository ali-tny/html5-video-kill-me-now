html5-video-kill-me-now
=======================
A minimal example of a frustrating bug I haven't manage to fix with getting
HTML5 videos to masquerade as gifs in Safari.

To run (with python 3):
- run `make run`
- go to [http://localhost:8001/1.html](http://localhost:8001/1.html) in Safari
- scroll down
- open a new tab then go back to the original
- pull hair out
